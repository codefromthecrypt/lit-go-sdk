Golang SDK for the Lit Protocol. Backed by a small grant from
LitProtocol.

https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/LitGrants/issues/11

## Dev Environment.

1. Make sure you have Docker installed.
2. Run `docker compose up --build` the first time to build the
   container and run the test suite. The tests will automatically
   reload when a file is changed.
